I designed this custom 2 layer pcb that runs a space inavder clone, albeit very slowly (as part of a high school project, It is powered by an attiny-20pu running at 16mhz and a 3v battery. The parts to build this are as follows:

//hardware//
- ssd1306 i2c display
- cr2032 battery holder ( through hole )
- attiny85-20pu
- 3x 6mm tactile buttons
- 1k ohm resistor
- 2x 10k ohm resistor
- 6.8k ohm resistor
- the custom pcb from the gerber files I provided ( you can order the pcb from an online service like jlcpcb or pcbway for example.)
